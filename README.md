My journey started with a small internship project which involved creating an Automated Attendance Management System for a company, I then went on to create a Real Time Anomaly Detection System that is also resource efficient. In my AI journey so far, I have learned how to do shell scripting and manipulate directories as I wish in linux and I have also re-brushed on many core concepts such as regression and classification algorithms and how they work. I am also learning about the efficiency of certain algorithms over others for similiar tasks, so I am also learning about how to use resources efficiently. I am also learning about the mathematical concepts behind the techniques and models being used in AI. It is going great so far.
